# BEAMLINE-DEISIGN-HEPS
This work relates to the beamline design work in High Energy Photon Source project since 2018.
Different simulation software, including srw, xrt, SHADOW-OUI, SHADOW-Hybrid, are used in the different beamline performance estimation, we appreciate the software developer's work.
In this project, we will include some data\examples\problems for the learner in HEPS, 

(1) beamline design report: 
for specific issue, simulation and theoretical study are carried out and summaried;
for specific beamline, series of simulation and study are done

(2) software 使用方法
example for HEPS beamline
example for data_analysis
code for specific function, such as error generation(from Ansys, metrology), optical module with error, analysis module and so on

(3)数据库
HEPS parameters
database for different error
