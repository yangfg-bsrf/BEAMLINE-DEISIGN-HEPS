# BEAMLINE DEISIGN related simulation and study@HEPS

This work relates to the beamline design work in High Energy Photon Source project since 2018.

Different simulation software, including srw, xrt, SHADOW-OUI, SHADOW-Hybrid, are used in the different beamline performance estimation, we appreciate the software developer's work.

In this project, we will include some data\examples\problems for the learners in HEPS. We have not considered developing the professional software. 

## how to design the beamline and simulation experiment

   (1) for specific issue, simulation and theoretical study are carried out and summarized;

   (2) for specific beamline, series of simulation and study are done

## how to program

   (1) Examples for HEPS beamlines

   (2) Examples for data_analysis

   (3) Codes for specific function, such as error generation(from Ansys, metrology), optical module with error, analysis module and so on

## other resources

   (1) HEPS parameters

   (2) Database for different kind of error
